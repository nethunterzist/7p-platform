## ðŸ”„ **STRIPE MIGRATION PATH**

### **When Stripe Integration is Ready:**

**1. Backend Change (1 line):**
```typescript
// src/services/enrollment-service.ts:185-191
// REMOVE:
// For now, assume payment is verified

// ADD:
const paymentVerified = await this.verifyStripePayment(paymentIntentId, course.price);
if (!paymentVerified) {
  throw new Error('Payment verification failed');
}
```

**2. Frontend Change:**
```typescript
// Replace MockPaymentModal with StripePaymentModal
// Keep same API call structure  
// Zero user experience change
```

**3. Benefits:**
- âœ… Zero database changes required
- âœ… Same API endpoints work  
- âœ… Seamless user experience transition
- âœ… All mock payment data converts to real payments

## ðŸ“Š **BETA ANALYTICS READY**

  courseId: course.id,
  originalPrice: course.price,
