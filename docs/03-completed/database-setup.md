- [ ] Test RLS policies with different user roles
- [ ] Verify all 9 tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] Run database connectivity test
- [ ] Perform migration dry run: `npm run db:migrate:dry`

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Validate environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Test rate limiting endpoints
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS connections
- [ ] Check audit logging is working
- [ ] Validate authentication flows

### Backup System
- [ ] Test backup creation: `node scripts/backup-production.js backup`
- [ ] Verify backup storage accessibility
- [ ] Test backup notifications
- [ ] Schedule automated backups
- [ ] Document restore procedures

### Monitoring & Alerts

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env.production` to version control
- Store production secrets in secure secret management service
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Monitor for exposed credentials in logs

### Database Access
- Service Role Key bypasses RLS - use only server-side
- Never expose Service Role Key to client-side code
- Monitor for suspicious database access patterns
- Implement IP-based access restrictions if possible

### Rate Limiting
- Configure Redis for distributed rate limiting in production
- Monitor rate limit violations for attack patterns
- Adjust limits based on actual usage patterns
- Implement bypass mechanisms for trusted sources

### Backup Security
- Encrypt all backup files
- Store backups in geographically distributed locations
- Test restore procedures regularly
- Implement backup integrity verification

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Launch)
1. **Security Review**: Address critical vulnerabilities identified in security audit
2. **Staging Test**: Deploy to staging environment and perform full testing
3. **Performance Test**: Load test with realistic traffic patterns
4. **Disaster Recovery Test**: Test backup and restore procedures

### Post-Launch Monitoring
1. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for security incidents
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track query performance and connection usage
3. **Backup Verification**: Regular automated backup testing
4. **Security Updates**: Regular security audits and updates

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Monitor system health and security alerts
- **Weekly**: Review performance metrics and rate limit violations
- **Monthly**: Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- **Quarterly**: Backup and disaster recovery testing
