## üß™ Testing Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment Validation**
```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $PAYMENTS_MODE        # Should be "disabled"
echo $FEATURE_ENROLL_FREE  # Should be "true"

# Health check
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
# Verify: stripe: null
```

2. **API Testing**
```bash
# Test payment endpoints are blocked
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"courseId":"test-id"}'
# Expected: 501 status

# Test free enrollment works
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/enroll/free \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{"courseId":"valid-course-id"}'
# Expected: 201 status
```

3. **UI Testing**
- [ ] Course cards show "TEST √úCRETSƒ∞Z" badges
- [ ] Purchase buttons replaced with enrollment buttons
- [ ] Purchase pages redirect properly
- [ ] Free enrollment flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Course access granted immediately after enrollment

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run payment guard tests
npm test tests/api/payment-guard.test.ts

# Run free enrollment tests
npm test tests/enrollment/free-enroll.test.ts

## üìä Monitoring & Health Checks

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **API Health**
   - `/api/health` response time and status
   - Payment endpoint 501 responses (should be 100%)
   - Free enrollment success rate

2. **Enrollment Metrics**
   - Free enrollments per hour/day
   - Enrollment failure rate
   - Time from enrollment to first content access

3. **User Experience**
   - Page load times for course pages
   - Bounce rate on purchase pages (should be low due to redirects)
   - User session duration

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Health check
curl -s https://your-domain.com/api/health | jq '.checks.stripe'
# Expected: null

# Payment endpoint status
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/create-payment-intent
# Expected: 501

# Free enrollment availability
curl -s https://your-domain.com/api/enroll/free \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' | jq '.success'
# Expected: false (but endpoint should respond)
```

### Alerting Setup

```yaml
# Example alerting rules
- alert: PaymentsNotDisabled
  expr: health_check_stripe_enabled == 1
  for: 1m
  annotations:
    summary: "Payments not properly disabled"
    
- alert: FreeEnrollmentDown
  expr: free_enrollment_success_rate < 0.95
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "Free enrollment success rate below 95%"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Payment Buttons Still Showing
**Symptom:** Course cards show payment buttons instead of enrollment buttons

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check environment
echo $PAYMENTS_MODE
# Should output: disabled

# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health | jq '.checks.stripe'
# Should output: null
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify `PAYMENTS_MODE=disabled` in environment
- Clear browser cache and CDN cache
- Restart application servers
- Check if environment variables are properly loaded

#### 2. Free Enrollment API Not Working
**Symptom:** `/api/enroll/free` returns 501 or 404

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check feature flag
echo $FEATURE_ENROLL_FREE
# Should output: true

# Check API directly
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/enroll/free \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

**Solutions:**
- Set `FEATURE_ENROLL_FREE=true`
- Verify API route is deployed
- Check database connectivity
- Review application logs

#### 3. Enrollment Code Issues
**Symptom:** Valid codes rejected or codes required when not set

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check enrollment code setting
echo $FREE_ENROLLMENT_CODE

# Test with/without code
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/enroll/free \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{"courseId":"test-id","code":"TEST_CODE"}'
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify code matches environment variable exactly
- Clear code variable if not needed: `unset FREE_ENROLLMENT_CODE`
- Check for whitespace or encoding issues

#### 4. Health Check Shows Payments Enabled
**Symptom:** Health endpoint shows `"stripe": true`

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check all related environment variables
env | grep -E "(PAYMENTS_MODE|STRIPE)"

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health | jq '.checks'
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure `PAYMENTS_MODE=disabled` (not `PAYMENTS_MODE=stripe`)
- Remove or unset `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Restart application to reload environment
- Check for environment variable conflicts

### Error Codes Reference

| Code | Endpoint | Meaning | Action |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| 501 | `/api/payments/*` | Payments disabled (expected) | Normal behavior |
| 501 | `/api/enroll/free` | Feature disabled | Set `FEATURE_ENROLL_FREE=true` |
| 401 | `/api/enroll/free` | Authentication required | Ensure user logged in |
| 403 | `/api/enroll/free` | Invalid enrollment code | Check code or remove requirement |
| 404 | `/api/enroll/free` | Course not found | Verify course ID and publication status |
| 409 | `/api/enroll/free` | Already enrolled | Normal behavior, user has access |
| 429 | `/api/enroll/free` | Rate limited | Wait and retry, check rate limits |

### Logs to Monitor

```bash
# Application logs
tail -f logs/application.log | grep -E "(payment|enroll|stripe)"

# Error logs
tail -f logs/error.log | grep -E "(501|payment|stripe)"

# Access logs
tail -f logs/access.log | grep -E "(/api/payments|/api/enroll)"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **User Data**: All user data handling remains secure
- **Course Content**: Full access control maintained
- **Audit Trails**: All enrollments logged with IP and user agent
- **Rate Limiting**: Applied to free enrollment endpoint

### Access Control
- **Authentication**: Required for all enrollment actions
- **Authorization**: Course-level permissions respected
- **Enrollment Codes**: Optional additional access control layer
- **Admin Functions**: Unaffected by payment mode changes

### Risk Mitigation
- **Abuse Prevention**: Rate limiting and enrollment validation
- **Data Integrity**: Full validation of course and user states
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Reversibility**: Easy rollback to payment-enabled mode

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: Data processing transparency maintained
- **Audit Requirements**: Enhanced logging for free enrollments
- **Terms of Service**: Consider updating for test/demo usage
- **Data Retention**: Standard policies apply to enrollment data

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

**Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable change
export PAYMENTS_MODE=stripe
# Restart application

# Option 2: Vercel environment (if using)
vercel env add PAYMENTS_MODE production stripe
# Redeploy application

# Option 3: Docker restart
docker restart your-app-container
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Confirm payments re-enabled
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health | jq '.checks.stripe'
# Should output: true or false (not null)

# Confirm payment endpoints work
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"courseId":"test"}'
# Should not return 501
```

### Planned Rollback

1. **Pre-rollback Checklist**
   - [ ] Ensure Stripe credentials are available
   - [ ] Verify payment processing infrastructure
   - [ ] Test payment endpoints in staging
   - [ ] Plan communication to users

2. **Rollback Steps**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Update environment
   PAYMENTS_MODE=stripe
   FEATURE_ENROLL_FREE=false  # Optional: disable free enrollment
   
   # Step 2: Deploy changes
   # (Method depends on deployment process)
   
   # Step 3: Verify functionality
   # - Test payment processing
   # - Check UI changes
   # - Monitor error rates
   ```

3. **Post-rollback Validation**
   - [ ] Payment processing works
   - [ ] UI shows payment buttons
   - [ ] Health checks pass
   - [ ] No 501 errors in logs

### Data Considerations

**Free Enrollments:** Users enrolled via free enrollment system retain access when payments are re-enabled. Consider:
- Migrating to appropriate payment plans
- Grandfathering free access
- Converting to trial periods

**Audit Data:** Maintain all enrollment audit logs for compliance and analysis.
