## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Authentication System Completely Disabled
**Location**: `/src/middleware.ts`
**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**CVSS Score**: 10.0

**Description**: The main authentication middleware is completely disabled, returning `NextResponse.next()` without any security checks.

```typescript
// CRITICAL: No authentication protection
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.next(); // ‚Üê BYPASSES ALL SECURITY
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Complete bypass of authentication and authorization
- Unrestricted access to protected routes and admin functions
- Potential for data theft, account takeover, and system compromise

**Remediation Checklist**:
- [ ] Immediately enable `AuthProtectionMiddleware.protect()` in middleware
- [ ] Test authentication flow on all protected routes
- [ ] Implement role-based access control validation
- [ ] Add session timeout and concurrent session limits
- [ ] Enable CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### 2. Database Credentials Exposed in Production
**Location**: `.env.local`, `.env.production`
